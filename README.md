# refactoring
refactoring the index.html file into a modern structured web dirctory , using bootstrap components and additional CSS styles makes the website more accessible , modern and most importantly is the greate performance the website has reached.

in this website , the user can navigate to different pages of the website using the navbar and read all the articels of their interest , and no worry of scrolling too far cause there will always be a button that move the user back up once it's clicked on. 

and ofcourse users can contact us using the form at the end of the page.
